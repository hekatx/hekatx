### Hola!

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer based in Mexico. I'm looking for remote work oportunities that involve React and Typescript (and maybe THREE.js? ðŸ‘€).

### Stuff I use 

- Programming languages: Go, Typescript, Lua.
- Frameworks: React (yeah I know that technically it's a library), Express, Echo, Gorilla.
- Human languages: Spanish, English. 
- Current interests: Neovim API, Computational Chemistry, 3D.

### Things I enjoy besides programming

- Painting
- Reading fiction (currently going through The Three-Body Problem)
- Writing haikus

###  How to reach me
